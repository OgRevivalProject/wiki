The Australian *Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment* case is taken to High Court and it is ruled that Sony's PlayStation was designed to prevent illegal copies of games being played, and was not  designed to prevent illegal copying. Because of this, it does not  qualify as a "technological protection measure" (TPM) device as they  claimed and thus modchips are declared legal in Australia again.
