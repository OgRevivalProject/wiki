Today the Australian *Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment* case is brought to High Court and is ruled that Sony's PlayStation was not designed to prevent illegal *copying* and because of this its illegal *playback* prevention measures are deemed to not qualify as a "technological protection measure" (TPM) device as they  claimed. This ruling leads to modchips becoming legal in Australia again.
