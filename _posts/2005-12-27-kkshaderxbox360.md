A kiosk demo disc is found to be bootable from burned discs. User "Tser" discovers that he can edit the script files that compile a shader at  runtime in the *Peter Jackson's King Kong* demo on the kiosk demo disc. This is the first instance of homebrew code running at a level  outside of userland, as the GPU processes it.
