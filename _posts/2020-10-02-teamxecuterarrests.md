The FBI announces that Max Louarn (MAXiMiLiEN) and Gary Bowser (GaryOPA from MaxConsole) of Team Xecuter were [arrested  and extradited to the United States to be charged with 11 felonies  including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to  circumvent technological measures and to traffic in circumvention  devices, trafficking in circumvention devices, and conspiracy to commit  money laundering](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-members-notorious-videogame-piracy-group-team-xecuter-custody). It is apparent that Nintendo may have instigated  this case as the article makes many mentions to Nintendo devices,  especially SX OS on the Nintendo Switch.
