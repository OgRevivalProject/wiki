# DashLaunch

DashLaunch is a tool for tweaking deep system settings. **You must save your changes if you make any modifications.**

### It is recommended to install this app on a RGH/JTAG. Though limited in function as a Dashboard, it is a powerful configuration manager.

- The default username/password for FTP is "xbox" and "xbox".
- This can be changed through the configuration menu.

Video tutorials on installing and configuring DashLaunch are available from [Modded Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2zCQD0RaeA) and [XeXSolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJcHQUk9S20)

- A console capable of running unsigned code.

The optimal value is different per system, but it's generally recommended to choose target temperatures below 70Â°C that don't run the fan too loudly.
